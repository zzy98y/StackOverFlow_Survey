# StackOverFlow_Survey
# Questions in the project 
1. Do the frequency of working remotely affects how often do people contribute the open source?
2. With all the survey who answered have a full-time job, what is the most common Education Level?
3. With people who got a bachelor degree and a full time job, what percentage of the people are actually satisfied with their jobs?
Is an advanced degree will lead to more job satisfactions?
# Data and Preparartion
You can find data through this link here: [2019 StackOverFlowData](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

My main analysis is included in this jupyter notebook called stackoverflow.ipynb

You need the following python package for Analysis:

* Pandas

* Numpy

* Seaborn

* Matplotlib

# Observation on Questions
> Q1: It seems that most people don't contribute to open source, but we're able to see a trend in the graph people that people are more frequent and more likely to contribute to an open source if they remote less frequent. I believe this may be in an office setting people are more likely to get their work done when they're working in an office, and they will have extra time to contribute and improve their work. Remote work will be more focus on finishing the work by due day, even people who would like to contribute would more likely to forget after they finish.

> Q2: From the above pie chart, we're able to see that half of the population who have a full time only got bachelor degree. This make me thinking that maybe degree is not the most important factor when comes to do technical jobs,what's more important is how to write better and more efficient code. 

> Q3: From the above two plots, we're able to see that the there is nearly 60% of the people who have bachelor degree are either slightly satisfied or very satisfied with the full time job. I also did the same for people with master degrees and found similar results. This is an indication that Education Level does not determine how satisfy you are with the job you have. I think it's more important whether you like doing technical work like coding rather than the level of education you achieved.
